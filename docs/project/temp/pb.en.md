:::tip

## Event Introduction

The Winter Paintboard is an online pixel canvas contest well-known in the OI community. It is said that such activities originated from Reddit’s [r/place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/place) event on April Fool’s Day 2017, which lasted for $72$ hours with a $5$-minute cooldown. The Luogu platform also launched similar events on New Year’s Day in 2021 and 2022. Since the event was held in winter, it was named the Winter Paintboard.

Users use their Tokens to outline various OI-related figures on the paintboard. There are famous OI IPs such as Chtholly and Touhou Project, emblems of major OI schools, singers like Yuezheng Ling, Luo Tianyi, and Hatsune Miku, and game themes such as Arknights, Genshin Impact, and Touhou. Many “factions” compete for territory here — some gather many Tokens to maintain their images, while others use Tokens for random pixel attacks to fight against rivals. In short, many users have left their marks here.

However, this well-received and popular event did not continue. While various groups were preparing for the next year’s Winter Paintboard, in 2023, the official Luogu Winter Paintboard did not arrive as expected, and the event time on the [Luogu Paintboard](https://www.luogu.com.cn/paintboard) page has been forever frozen at:

> 2022/01/01 00:00 ~ 2022/01/04 00:30 ...

Later, under the initiative of GitHub user [@IceCang](https://github.com/IceCang), they decided to continue hosting the 2023 Winter Paintboard under the name **AyakaCraft Paintboard**.  
By referencing the official Luogu Winter Paintboard UI, **LS Paintboard** successfully restored its art style.  
At the same time, LS Paintboard adopted Luogu’s upgrade from cookie sharing to token sharing and creatively used clipboard IDs for user verification, following the original rule that each verified Luogu account owns one drawing right. The events from 2023 to 2025 were held successfully, allowing many users to participate.

Thus, the Winter Paintboard event did not end with the suspension of the official version but has instead been passed down year after year as a community event. By February 2026, during the Spring Festival, it will mark the sixth year of Luogu users participating in the Winter Paintboard.  
We sincerely invite everyone to join in, use your Token to paint your own pixel on this online canvas, and leave your mark in the Winter Paintboard.

Let us wish the Winter Paintboard continued success, and may our Winter Paintboard last forever!
