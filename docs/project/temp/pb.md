The initial phase of the public test is a stress test with a short cooldown time, and the paintboard server will be under significant pressure. If the server crashes during this period, please do not worry about its stability.

## Event Introduction

The Winter Paintboard is an activity where participants compete for pixels on a network canvas, well-known within the OI (Olympiad in Informatics) community. This type of event is said to have originated from the [r/place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/place) event on Reddit during April Fools' Day in 2017, which lasted for $72$ hours with a $5$-minute cooldown time for drawing. The Luogu platform also held similar events on New Year's Day in 2021 and 2022. Since the events were held in winter, they were named "Winter Paintboard."

Users use their Tokens to sketch the outlines of various figures from the OI community on the paintboard. The content includes well-known IPs from the OI circle like Chtholly and Touhou Project, school emblems of top OI schools, singers like Yuezheng Ling, Luo Tianyi, and Hatsune Miku, and games like Arknights, Genshin Impact, and Touhou. Many "factions" compete for territory here. They either gather many Tokens to maintain their images or use Tokens to randomly place pixels to fight against other factions. In short, many users have left their mark here.

However, this highly acclaimed and popular event did not continue. While various factions were preparing for the new year's Winter Paintboard, the official Luogu Winter Paintboard did not arrive as scheduled on New Year's Day 2023. The event time on the [Luogu Winter Paintboard](https://www.luogu.com.cn/paintboard) interface remains frozen at `2022/01/01 00:00 ~ 2022/01/04 00:30`...

Later, initiated by GitHub user [@IceCang](https://github.com/IceCang), they decided to continue hosting the 2023 Winter Paintboard under the name AyakaCraft Paintboard. Drawing inspiration from the UI of the official Luogu Winter Paintboard, LS Paintboard managed to restore its style. At the same time, LS Paintboard learned from the Luogu platform's two-year upgrade from Cookie sharing to Token sharing and creatively used clipboard IDs for user verification, following the original rule of one real-name authenticated Luogu account having one drawing permission. The events from 2023 to 2025 were held as scheduled, successfully engaging many users.

Thus, the Winter Paintboard event, instead of ending with the discontinuation of the official paintboard, has been passed down year after year in the form of a community-run event. By the time of the Spring Festival in February 2026, it will be the sixth year that Luogu users have participated in the Winter Paintboard. We sincerely invite you, the reader, to participate. Use your Token to add your unique touch to this corner of the internet canvas and leave your mark on the Winter Paintboard.

Let's wish the Winter Paintboard continued success and an everlasting future!
