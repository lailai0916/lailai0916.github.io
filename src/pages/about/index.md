## Personal Introduction

🎓 I am a middle school student from Hangzhou, China.

💻 Passionate about mathematics and programming, enthusiastic about technology, and enjoy exploring new things.

💡 Strong self-learning ability and problem-solving skills, good at independent thinking and hands-on practice.

🛠️ Focus on clean and standardized code, pursuing clear structure and consistent style.

✍️ Enjoy organizing the learning process and recording thoughts for convenient communication and sharing.

## Website Introduction

My personal website for sharing technical notes, project experience, and learning insights.

Built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) and open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/lailai0916/lailai0916.github.io).

## My Nickname

My nickname is **lailai**. Since this name is quite common, I often have trouble registering accounts.

To solve this, I usually add my birthday digits **0916**, forming **lailai0916**.

If that is also taken, I convert the digits to hexadecimal **0x394**, forming **lailai0x394**.
